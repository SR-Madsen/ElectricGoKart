ERROR: [XSIM 43-3217] PWM_Generator_v1_0_S00_AXI_vhdl.prj (line 2): Incorrect project file syntax. Correct syntax is one of: vhdl <worklib> <file>, verilog <worklib> <file> [<file> ...] [[-d <macro>] ...] [[-i <include>] ...], or NOSORT. Presence of NOSORT on a line of its own disables file order sorting.
